## 🔵 Prepare & Model Data

### Power Query Workflow
Connect → Transform → Clean → Load. Always validate column data types before loading.

| Task | Tool | Why it matters |
|------|------|----------------|
| Append datasets | Append Queries | Adds rows (stack files). |
| Join tables | Merge Queries | Combines tabeles based on key Match. Adds columns via key match. |
| Reorder columns | `Table.ReorderColumns` | Improves readability and export order. |

💡 *Transform in Power Query first; calculated columns should rarely fix data quality issues.*

### Star Schema Essentials
- Fact tables hold transactions (e.g., `Sales`), dimension tables hold attributes (`Product`, `Customer`, `Date`).
- Relationships default to **one-to-many** (1\*). Avoid many-to-many unless you truly have a bridging scenario.
- Mark the Date table as a **Date Table** so time intelligence works.

### Relationship Management
- **Single direction** filters flow from dimension ➝ fact; safest default.
- **Both directions** only when you need shared slicers (e.g., role-playing Date) or many-to-many patterns.
- Use `USERELATIONSHIP()` to activate inactive relationships in specific measures.

📝 **Mini Exam Q:** Finance and Sales reports share one `Date` table and need shared slicers. → Enable bi-directional filtering **only** on the Date relationship, or use a role-playing Date dimension per model design guidelines.

## 🧩 Relationship Cardinality — One-to-Many vs Many-to-Many
Type	Definition	Example	Exam Clue

- 1: (One-to-Many)*	One unique key filters many records	Customer → Sales	Most common, default relationship
- Many:Many  (Many-to-Many)	Both sides contain duplicate keys	Products ↔ Promotions	Requires composite or bridge table
- 1:1 (One-to-One)	Unique match between two tables	Employee → EmployeeDetails	Used for column splitting or security
- Inactive Relationship	Exists but not used unless activated	Alternate date (e.g., ShipDate vs OrderDate)	Use USERELATIONSHIP() in DAX

## 🧠 Memory Hook

"Dimension filters fact — one filters many."

## 🧩 Exam-Style Relationship Questions
Q1. A single Product row links to many Sales transactions.
→ ✅ One-to-Many (Product[ProductID] → Sales[ProductID])

Q2. Two tables each contain multiple duplicate keys.
→ ✅ Many-to-Many (needs bridge or composite relationship)

Q3. You need a report using both OrderDate and ShipDate slicers.
→ ✅ Create two relationships, one active, one inactive.
Then use:

Sales by Ship Date =
CALCULATE([Total Sales], USERELATIONSHIP('Date'[Date], Sales[ShipDate]))

---

## Core data modelling concepts 

## 🧩 Append VS Merge Example Scenario

“Multiple tables with the same columns, each containing data for a different month.”

Goal: Combine these monthly tables into one unified table for reporting.

✅ Correct Answer: Append Queries

## 🧠 Explanation

Append Queries = Stack tables vertically (add rows).

This method is used when:

Each table has identical column names and structure.

You want one combined table that contains all rows from each monthly file.

## Example:

January_Sales	February_Sales
Product	Product
Quantity	Quantity
Amount	Amount

## → After Append:

Product	Quantity	Amount
A	10	100
B	15	200
A	12	120

✅ Now, visuals and measures can aggregate across months.

❌ Incorrect: Merge Queries

## ⚙️ What Merge Does

Merge Queries = Join tables horizontally (add columns).
It’s like a VLOOKUP in Excel — it matches rows using a key field.

## Use Merge when:

Tables have different columns but share a common key (like CustomerID or OrderID).

You want to bring in additional fields from another table.

## Example:

Orders	Customers
OrderID	CustomerID
Amount	Name
CustomerID	Country

→ Merge on CustomerID → combines columns, not rows.

## 🧮 Quick Comparison Table
Feature	Append Queries	Merge Queries
Action	Stack rows (vertical union)	Join columns (horizontal join)
When to use	Monthly or regional tables with same columns	Related tables sharing a key
Analogy	UNION in SQL	JOIN in SQL
Output	Adds rows to one table	Adds columns to one table

## 🧠 Exam Tips - Append Vs Merge

If the question says:

“Same columns” → Append Queries ✅

“Related by key” → Merge Queries ✅

“Combine files from folder” → Combine Files ✅ (automates append for all files in a folder)

## 🧩 Memory Hook

“Append adds rows — Merge matches columns.”

## 🧩 Column Quality, Column Profile, and Column Distribution in Power Query

These three tools are part of Data Profiling in Power BI Power Query — they help you understand, clean, and validate your dataset before loading it into your data model.

You can enable them from:

Power Query Editor → View tab → Data Preview section

## 1️⃣ Column Quality

Purpose:
Shows data validity summary (valid, error, empty) for each column.

## Metric	Description - Column Quality
✅ Valid	Rows with acceptable / correctly formatted data.
⚠️ Error	Rows with formula or data type errors.
⚪ Empty	Null or blank values.

## Example:
If a Date column has 95% valid, 4% errors, 1% empty → you immediately know you need to fix the errors before loading.

## 💡 Exam Tip:

“Column Quality = how clean the column is.”

## 2️⃣ Column Profile

## Purpose:
Gives a detailed statistical summary of a single column’s data.

You can view it by selecting View → Column Profile → Column Statistics and selecting a column.

## Displays:

Count, distinct, unique, empty, error values

Minimum / Maximum (for numeric or date fields)

Average, standard deviation, count of nulls

For text: average length, distinct values

## Use Case - Column Profile:
Helps validate column logic — e.g., you can check that all sales amounts fall within expected numeric ranges.

## 💡 Exam Tip:

“Column Profile = deep dive into one column’s stats.”

## 3️⃣ Column Distribution

Purpose:
Visually displays how values are distributed — like a histogram or frequency chart for categorical data.

It shows:

Number of distinct and unique values

Graphical bar chart of frequency counts

## Use Case - Column Distribution:
Helps you spot data skew — e.g., if 80% of records belong to one product that could affect modeling.

## 💡 Exam Tip:

 “Column Distribution = visual snapshot of diversity and spread.”

## 🧠 Comparison Summary
Feature	Purpose	Type of Insight	Visual?	Scope
Column Quality	Data validity (valid, error, empty)	Data cleanliness	✅ Bars (green/yellow/gray)	Entire table
Column Profile	Statistics (mean, min, max, count)	Data distribution summary	❌ (textual table)	Single column
Column Distribution	Frequency of values	Diversity & frequency	✅ Histogram	Single column

## ⚙️ Best Practice

 Enable column Display, profile and Distribution:

Go to View tab → Data Preview

Check ✅ “Column Quality,” ✅ “Column Distribution,” ✅ “Column Profile”

(Optional) Enable Column profiling based on entire dataset

Default only scans first 1000 rows; for accuracy, use full data.

## 🧩 Exam Tip Table - Column profile, row , display and distribution

Exam Clue	Correct Answer
“Check % of valid vs empty rows”	Column Quality
“Find column min/max and unique counts”	Column Profile
“View graphical representation of data spread”	Column Distribution
“Shows green, gray, red bars below column headers”	Column Quality


## 🟢 DAX Fundamentals

### Core Aggregations
| Purpose | Function | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Total | `SUM()` | `SUM(Sales[Amount])` |
| Average | `AVERAGE()` | `AVERAGE(Sales[Amount])` |
| Row count | `COUNTROWS()` | `COUNTROWS(Sales)` |
| Distinct count | `DISTINCTCOUNT()` | `DISTINCTCOUNT(Customer[ID])` |
| Min / Max | `MIN()`, `MAX()` | `MIN(Product[Price])` |

### Iterators & Row Context

```dax
Total Profit =
SUMX(
    Sales,
    Sales[Quantity] * (Sales[Price] - Sales[Cost])
)
```
Use X-functions when the calculation references multiple columns or needs row context.
🧩 DATEADD — Comparing Current vs Prior Periods
🔹 Syntax
DATEADD(<dates>, <number_of_intervals>, <interval>)


Shifts a date column forward or backward by the specified number and interval (DAY, MONTH, QUARTER, YEAR).


## 🧠 How DATEADD Works

DATEADD() doesn’t aggregate; it returns a table of shifted dates.
Combine it with CALCULATE() to re-evaluate measures for a different period.

it can be used to 'compare' over time periods with the previous year. 

## Example DATEADD Comparison
Sales Previous Year =
CALCULATE(
    [Total Sales],
    DATEADD('Date'[Date], -1, YEAR)
)

## 🔍 Comparison DATEADD to DAX TIME INTELLIGENCE
Function	Behavior	Output	When to Use
DATEADD()	Shifts by any interval	Table of shifted dates	Flexible comparisons (e.g., -3 months)
SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR()	Shifts by one year, same shape	Table of same dates last year	Standard YoY
PARALLELPERIOD()	Shifts by fixed interval (month/quarter/year)	Table	Works even if dates aren’t continuous

## 🧠 Memory Hook

“DATEADD moves, CALCULATE compares.”

## 🧩 Exam-Style DATEADD Questions

Q1. You need a measure showing sales 6 months ago.
→ ✅ Use DATEADD('Date'[Date], -6, MONTH).

Q2. The dataset has missing dates (non-continuous).
→ ⚠️ DATEADD will fail — use PARALLELPERIOD.

Q3. Compare this month to the same month last year, same shape of dates.
→ ✅ Use SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR.

## 🧩 Common Mistakes Summary DATEADD
Function	Mistake	Fix
ALL()	Used when filter context needed	Use ALLSELECTED() or ALLEXCEPT()
DATEADD()	Non-continuous dates cause error	Use PARALLELPERIOD()
Relationships	Forgetting cardinality direction	Always ensure dimension filters fact
USERELATIONSHIP()	Forgotten for inactive dates	Activate explicitly in measure

## 🧠 Memory Tricks DATEADD DAX

ALL = All data, ignore slicers

1:* = Dimension filters fact

DATEADD = Shift, not sum

USERELATIONSHIP = Hidden link between two worlds
---
### Context Control with CALCULATE
```dax
Profit 2024 =
CALCULATE(
    SUM(Sales[Profit]),
    YEAR(Sales[Date]) = 2024
)
```
`CALCULATE` changes filter context—most tested function on PL-300. Pair it with `ALL`, `FILTER`, or time intelligence functions to overwrite default filters.

---

## 🟢 Intermediate DAX Patterns

### Time Intelligence
```dax
Sales YTD = TOTALYTD([Total Sales], 'Date'[Date])
Sales LY = CALCULATE([Total Sales], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date]))
YoY Change = [Sales YTD] - [Sales LY]
```
Mark your Date table; use a continuous date column.

| Function | Purpose | Pitfall |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR` | Shifts current context back one year | Retains shape; needs consecutive dates. |
| `PREVIOUSYEAR` | Fetches entire prior year | Returns full-year table, not matched range. |
| `DATEADD` | Shifts by custom interval | Requires contiguous date column. |
| `PARALLELPERIOD` | Similar to `DATEADD` | Works on non-regular calendars but slower. |

### VAR / RETURN for Clarity
```dax
Profit Margin % =
VAR TotalSales = SUM(Sales[Amount])
VAR TotalCost  = SUM(Sales[Cost])
RETURN
DIVIDE(TotalSales - TotalCost, TotalSales)
```
`VAR` stores intermediate results improving readability and performance.

### Filter Overrides
```dax
Enrollments 2019 =
CALCULATE(
    [Total Enrollments],
    FILTER(ALL('Date'), 'Date'[Year] = 2019)
)
```
- `ALL()` removes filters on a column/table.
- `FILTER()` reapplies only the logic you specify.
- Use `COUNTROWS(FILTER(...))` for conditional row counts (e.g., enrollments > 1000).

## 🧩 Exam-Style Questions ALL 

Q1. You need to show a region’s sales as a % of global sales, ignoring filters.
→ ✅ Use CALCULATE([Total Sales], ALL(Sales)).

Q2. You need to rank regions based on slicer selection only.
→ ✅ Use ALLSELECTED().

Q3. The report must calculate total profit unaffected by a page slicer.
→ ✅ Use ALL() on the relevant table or column.

## Summary Comparison Table - calculated vs COUNTROWS maxising model performance
Approach	Where Done	Model Size	Query Performance	Meets Requirement?
Calculated Measure (COUNTROWS)	DAX (post-load)	❌ Large	❌ Slow (row scan)	❌ No
Calculated Table (summarize after load)	DAX (post-load)	❌ Large pre-aggregation	⚠️ Partial	⚠️ Not ideal
Power Query “Group By”	ETL (pre-load)	✅ Small	✅ Fast	✅ Correct

## 🧠 Exam Tip

“If the question mentions minimizing model size always think aggregation before import never a calculated measure.”

## Minimising model memeory tricks 

Calculated eg. COUNTROWS slow and loads everything
Aggregation eg. Power query Group by = fast and minimises time

### Handling Sparse Data
```dax
Trailing 12M Enrollments =
VAR LastDateWithData =
    LASTNONBLANK('Date'[Date], [Total Enrollments])
RETURN
CALCULATE(
    [Total Enrollments],
    DATESINPERIOD('Date'[Date], LastDateWithData, -12, MONTH)
)
```
LASTNONBLANK ensures rolling windows ignore gaps; `LASTDATE` can return blanks when data skips months.

## 🧩 LASTDATE vs LASTNONBLANK — Time Intelligence Core Difference

Both functions return a single date, but the logic behind how they find it differs especially when blank values exist.

## Function, Purpose, Behavior,Use Case

LASTDATE(column) returns the last date in the current context	Ignores blanks only in the date columnWhen you’re sure every date has data
LASTNONBLANK(column, expression) returns the last date where the given expression isn’t blank	Ignores blanks based on the measure expression When data may have gaps (missing months, nulls, etc.)

## 🧠 Example: Comparing UNICHAR and LASTNOBLANK

Imagine you have sales data missing for a few months:

Date	Sales
Jan	100
Feb	200
Mar	blank
Apr	blank
LastDate = LASTDATE('Date'[Date])
LastWithSales = LASTNONBLANK('Date'[Date], [Total Sales])


LASTDATE returns April the last date in the column, even though there are no sales.

LASTNONBLANK returns February the last date that actually had sales data.

That’s why LASTNONBLANK is more reliable in rolling or trailing period calculations.

## ⚙️ Ignoring Blank Spaces - LASTDATE vs LASTNOBLANK

Blanks in DAX are not treated as “empty strings”; they are actual nulls.

LASTDATE simply goes to the latest date value.

LASTNONBLANK actively skips dates with no expression result.
If your table has data gaps, LASTNONBLANK ensures your visuals or calculations (like rolling averages or DATEADD offsets) don’t break or show blank results.

## ✅ Summary Table
Function	Returns	Ignores Blanks?	Typical Usage
UNICHAR	Text (symbol)	N/A	Replace text/boolean with icons in visuals
LASTDATE	Single date	Only skips missing date values	Full continuous calendar (no gaps)
LASTNONBLANK	Single date	Skips blank expressions	Trailing periods for sparse data handling

### Visual Indicators
```dax
Has Appointments =
IF(
    COUNTROWS(Appointments) > 0,
    UNICHAR(0x2611),    -- ☑️
    ""
)
```
UNICHAR renders symbols in matrix/text visuals. Avoid confusing it with `CHAR` older version that does not support emojis. UNICHAR  supportwed power BI.

But beyond that range (≥128), UNICHAR supports thousands of character  while CHAR breaks.

## 🔹 What UNICHAR Does

UNICHAR() returns a Unicode character (symbol) based on its numeric code.
It’s technically a text function, because its output is always text even if it looks like a symbol or icon.

## 🔹 Syntax
UNICHAR(128515)   -- 😀
UNICHAR(0x2611)   -- ☑️ Checkbox

## 🔹 When to Use UNICHAR

To show visual cues inside a Table, Matrix, or Card visual.

To replace binary results (TRUE/FALSE) with readable icons — e.g. a checkmark, star, or arrow.

Often used with IF() or SWITCH() for KPIs or conditional formatting.

 ## ✅ Example

Has Appointment =
IF(
    COUNTROWS(Appointments) > 0,
    UNICHAR(0x2611),  -- ☑️
    UNICHAR(0x2610)   -- ☐
)


SUNICHAR is a text function, and its use is mostly presentationfocused rather than analytical.

## 🟠 Visualize & Analyze

### Slicers vs Visuals
| Feature | Visual | Slicer |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Purpose | Displays data | Filters visuals |
| Interaction | Passive | User-driven |
| Scope | Single visual | Page or synced pages |

- Tile layout slicers double as KPI selectors.
- Field parameters let users toggle measures/dimensions without bookmarks.

📝 **Mini Exam Q:** Need to switch between revenue and profit quickly → Create a **field parameter** and add both measures.

### Cross Filtering vs Cross Highlighting
| Concept | Behavior | Use Case |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Cross filter | Selection filters target visual | Focus entirely on selected context. |
| Cross highlight | Selection highlights matching portion | Compare selection against totals. |

Configure via **Format ➝ Edit interactions**: funnel icon = filter, circle icon = highlight, slash = disable.

💡 Slicers only filter; they never highlight.

### Visual Best Bets
- **Decomposition Tree:** automated root-cause drill-downs with AI splits.
- **Box-and-Whisker / Percentile line:** median = 50th percentile; highlight percentile to answer “Which visual shows median?” questions.
- **Alerting:** only works on **Power BI Service dashboards** (not Desktop).

---

## 🟢 Quick DAX Reference Table
| Category | Function | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Aggregation | `SUM`, `AVERAGE` | `SUM(Sales[Revenue])` |
| Iterators | `SUMX`, `AVERAGEX` | `SUMX(Sales, Sales[Qty] * Sales[Price])` |
| Context | `CALCULATE`, `FILTER`, `ALL` | `CALCULATE([Sales], ALL(Sales))` |
| Time | `TOTALYTD`, `SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR` | `TOTALYTD([Sales], 'Date'[Date])` |
| Logic | `IF`, `SWITCH(TRUE())` | `SWITCH(TRUE(), [Value] > 1000, "High", "Low")` |

Memory hooks:  
- *“CALCULATE controls context.”*  
- *“ALL removes; FILTER refines.”*  
- *“Visuals display, slicers slice, filters fix.”*

## 🟣 Deploy & Govern

### Workspace Roles
| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| Viewer | Read-only for reports/dashboards. |
| Contributor | Publish reports, edit, but cannot manage access. |
| Member | Publish + manage access. |
| Admin | Full control including workspace settings. |

Only Members/Admins manage permissions; Contributors cannot share.

### Dataset Storage Modes
| Mode | Storage | Refresh | Gateway needed? | Best for |
|------|---------|---------|-----------------|----------|
| Import | Power BI | Scheduled / manual | ✅ likely | Fast, cached reports. |
| DirectQuery | Source DB | Real-time query | ✅ yes | Near real-time relational data. |
| Live Connection | SSAS / AAS | Instant (model hosted) | ❌ uses existing model | Enterprise semantic models. |

Common mix-up: Azure Analysis Services uses **Live Connection** not DirectQuery.

### Power Query Parameters
- Create parameter → reference in `Sql.Database(ParameterServer, ParameterDatabase)`.
- Enables Dev/Test/Prod swaps without rewriting queries.
- Avoid manual find-and-replace or multiple copies of the same query.

### Deployment Flow
Dataset → Report → Dashboard → App. Publish to workspace, then bundle into an app for business users.

---

## 🔵 Power Query Tips

### Replace Values in Text Columns
```powerquery
Table.ReplaceValue(
    SalesLT_Address,
    "1318",
    "1319",
    Replacer.ReplaceText,
    {"AddressLine1"}
)
```
Replaces substring matches inside specified columns.

## Steps using performance Analyser - identofying slow visuals 

1️⃣ Add a blank report page (avoid cached visuals)
2️⃣ Restart Power BI Desktop (clear cache)
3️⃣ Start recording in Performance Analyzer
4️⃣ Interact with visuals
5️⃣ Stop recording & review visual performance times

 Measures: DAX Query, Visual Display, and Other time

## Power BI Service and sending Alert updates

## 🧩 Rule of Thumb — “Subscription vs Alert”
Situation	What They Want	Correct Feature	Why
They want regular updates (daily/weekly/monthly)	“Send me this report every morning.”	✅ Subscription	Sends a scheduled snapshot of a report or dashboard.
They want to be notified when a metric crosses a threshold	“Alert me when profit < $100 K.”	⚙️ Data Alert	Fires only when a condition is met — not on schedule.
They just want to see changes in the Service	“I’ll check my dashboard anytime.”	No alert or subscription needed	They can view in Power BI Service directly.

## 🧠 Exam Strategy

When the question wording is vague or ambiguous:

Default to Subscription if it mentions any kind of regular / scheduled / daily / recurring notification.

Treat Alert as niche — only use it when a threshold trigger is explicitly stated.

⚠️ Why Alerts Are “Less Useful” for Regular Updates

Because:

They don’t trigger unless the metric crosses your defined limit.

They’re per-user only (each person must set it up manually).

They don’t send full dashboards — just numeric threshold notices.

In contrast, Subscriptions:

Can be created by anyone with at least Viewer access.

Deliver whole report snapshots automatically.

Are time-based, not condition-based — making them ideal for routine updates or executives who want daily KPIs.

🧩 Memory Hook

“If it’s time-based → Subscription.
If it’s threshold-based → Alert.”

### JSON & Web APIs
```powerquery
let
    Source  = Json.Document(Web.Contents("https://api.example.com/data")),
    Records = Source[records],
    Output  = Table.FromRecords(Records)
in
    Output
```
`Json.Document` parses API payloads; convert to records/tables for modeling.

---
## Tricky questions and common exam traps 

## 🧩 Extensibility: Node.js, Python, JSON

### Node.js — Custom Visuals SDK
- Install: `npm install -g powerbi-visuals-tools`
- Build workflow:
  ```bash
  pbiviz new MyVisual
  pbiviz start
  pbiviz package
  ```
- Role: packages and tests custom visuals with JavaScript/TypeScript. Not used for core modeling inside Power BI Desktop.

### Python — Analytics Scripts
- Runs directly in Power BI Desktop for data shaping and visuals.
```python
import pandas as pd
df = dataset.groupby("Region")["Sales"].sum().reset_index()
```
- Enable via **File ➝ Options ➝ Python scripting** (set home directory).
- Supports advanced analytics visuals (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly). Service refresh requires an on-prem gateway with the same Python environment.

### JSON — Configuration Backbone
- **Themes:** store colors, fonts, styles (`.json` theme files).
- **Custom visuals:** manifest settings inside `.pbiviz` packages.
- **REST/API:** Power BI REST API requests/responses are JSON.
- **Power Query:** `Json.Document` converts web JSON to tables.

| Technology | Role | Used inside Power BI engine? | Typical exam clue |
|------------|------|------------------------------|-------------------|
| Node.js | Build & package custom visuals | ❌ external tool | “Which environment develops custom visuals?” |
| Python | Data transformation & visuals | ✅ (local runtime) | “Which scripting language adds statistical charts?” |
| JSON | Metadata & data exchange | ✅ (format) | “Which format defines report themes?” |


## 🧩 Exam Traps & Memory Boosters
- Forgetting to mark Date tables → time intelligence returns blanks.
- Using bi-directional filters everywhere → unexpected totals; reserve for shared dimensions.
- Mixing calculated columns and measures in answers → evaluate required context (row vs filter).
- Attempting alerts in Desktop → must pin visual to Service dashboard and set alert there.
- Choosing DirectQuery for Analysis Services → only Live Connection works.
- Using `VALUES` when `ALL` is required for true all-table comparisons.

### Quick Recall Grid
| Concept | Pattern | Snap Memory |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| YoY comparison | `CALCULATE` + `SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR` | “Shift one year, keep shape.” |
| Rolling window | `DATESINPERIOD` + `LASTNONBLANK` | “Move back, skip gaps.” |
| Conditional counts | `COUNTROWS(FILTER())` | “Row-level WHERE logic.” |
| Icon flags | `IF` + `UNICHAR` | “Text-based symbols.” |
| Replace text | `Table.ReplaceValue` | “Substring replace in PQ.” |
| Root cause | Decomposition Tree | “Why, not just what.” |
| Median visual | Percentile line (50%) | “50th percentile = median.” |
| Multi-env | Parameters | “Dynamic connection string.” |

## 🧩 Web Scraping vs JSON Data in Power BI


Web Scraping is a Power BI feature that allows you to navigate through HTML tags to extract data from a webpage.
When you use the Web connector in Power BI Desktop (Get Data → Web), Power Query displays a Navigator pane that lists:

* Detected HTML tables

* Document view (HTML structure)

* Option to transform data by traversing HTML nodes (like <table>, <div>, etc.)

💡 Essentially, Web Scraping lets Power BI read structured or semi-structured data directly from web pages, even if no API is provided.

⚙️ Example

Scenario:
You connect to a Wikipedia page with financial tables (e.g., "List of countries by GDP").

let
    Source = Web.Page(Web.Contents("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP")),
    Data = Source{0}[Data]
in
    Data

Web.Contents() loads the web page.

Web.Page() tells Power BI to interpret HTML and extract tabular structures.

The Navigator shows all detected tables ready for load.

⚠️ Common Confusion — “Get JSON Data” vs “Web Scraping”
Feature	Description	When to Use	Typical File Format
Web Scraping	Extracts HTML elements (tables, divs, tags)	For standard web pages	.html
Get JSON Data	Extracts structured data from an API endpoint or .json file	When site exposes a REST API or JSON feed	.json

So, if the question mentions “HTML tags”, “web pages”, or “tables within a website”,
➡️ Answer: Web Scraping

If it mentions “API”, “endpoint”, “structured feed”, “JSON object”,
➡️ Answer: Get JSON Data

❌ Incorrect Option: Scaffolding

“Scaffolding” is unrelated to Power BI’s data extraction — it’s a software development term for automatically generating project structure or code templates (not used in Power BI).

## 🧠 Exam Tips - Get JSON Vs Web Scraping

“HTML tags → Web Scraping
APIs or JSON files → Get JSON Data”


### 🧩 Web Scraping vs JSON Data

| Feature | Data Source Type | Extracts From | Example Use |
|----------|------------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Web Scraping** | HTML web pages | `<table>`, `<div>`, `<span>` | Import data from Wikipedia or online dashboards |
| **Get JSON Data** | REST APIs / JSON feeds | JSON objects | Import structured data from APIs |

**Key Rule:**  
If question mentions “HTML tags” → **Web Scraping**  
If it mentions “API” or “endpoint” → **Get JSON Data**

# Measure vs calculated Column

A measure is an aggregation of data, while a calculated column is a new column created from existing data.

# 🧠 Concept Simplified
Feature	Calculated Column	Measure
Definition	Adds a new field (column) to your table.	Performs aggregation on your data.
Calculated At	Row level (each row evaluated).	Filter level (depends on visuals, slicers).
Storage	Stored in model → increases file size.	Not stored → calculated on the fly.
Context	Row Context.	Filter Context.
Example	Profit = Sales[Revenue] - Sales[Cost]	Total Profit = SUM(Sales[Profit])
Performance	Slower (uses memory).	Faster (computed dynamically).

# 🧩 Exam Tip - Measure vs caluculated column

“If it adds a column → Calculated Column.
If it adds a value in a visual → Measure.”

# How to manage it in the exam (Meausure and calculated column)

- Look for keywords like “new field”, “new column”, or “row-level” → choose Calculated Column.

- Look for words like “sum”, “average”, “aggregation”, “in visuals”, “total” → choose Measure.

If the question mentions “affected by filters/slicers”, always go with Measure — columns don’t react to visuals dynamically.

# ⚠️ Common Mistakes Measure & calculated column
Trap	Why Wrong

- “Measure = single column calc”	Measures aggregate across many rows, not just one column.
- “Calculated column = aggregation”	Columns cannot aggregate — they work row by row.
- “Calculated columns are dynamic”	❌ They are static; only recalc when data refreshes.

# 💡 Memory Hook - Measure & calculated column
“Column = Created field, stored.
Measure = Mathematical summary, dynamic.”

# Purpose of Data flows in power BI

# 🧠 Concept Simplified

Dataflows are Power Query in the cloud.
They let you extract, transform, and load data (ETL) at the service level — reusable across multiple datasets and reports.

# ⚙️ Key Characteristics

# ⚠️ Common Exam Trap - Purpose of Data Flows

Option like “Manage data sources” is partially correct but not the primary purpose.

Always look for “Transform and Clean Data” as the right answer.

## Main focus of data flows is to transform and clean data tehn manage.

# 💡 Memory Hook

“Dataflows flow your transformations —
Datasets set your models.”

# 🧩 Exam Strategy - Purpose Data Flow

If the question mentions “transform”, “Power Query”, or “reusable tables” → ✅ Dataflow

If it says “visualize”, “build measures”, or “relationships” → ✅ Dataset

## 🧩 Connecting to an Endorsed Dataset (Azure SQL vs Dataset)

## 🧠 Explanation

When a company already has an endorsed dataset published to the Power BI Service, that dataset is the single source of truth — it contains standardized data models, measures, hierarchies, and business logic.

Creating your own connection directly to the Azure SQL Database would bypass governance and lead to inconsistent definitions.

Instead, you should connect via:

Power BI Desktop → Get Data → Power BI Datasets → Select the endorsed dataset

This creates a Live Connection to the published dataset in Power BI Service.

## ⚙️ Connection Modes Comparison

Connection Mode	Description	Editable Model?	Typical Use
Import	Data copied into .pbix	✅ Yes	Fast reports, small data
DirectQuery	Queries the source in real time	✅ Yes	Large databases
Live Connection	Connects to published dataset (no schema editing)	❌ No	Centralized corporate models

## 💡 Key Takeaways - Endoresed Data Sets

Endorsed datasets are shared, validated datasets approved for reuse.

Live connection allows report creation without duplicating or altering the data model.

Do NOT use Dataflows for this scenario — they are for data transformation before dataset creation, not for connecting reports.

Do NOT connect directly to the Azure SQL — that breaks standardization.

## ⚠️ Common Exam Traps - Exam example connecting to Endoresed data sets 

Option	Why It’s Wrong
“Create a new local dataset connecting to Azure SQL”	Duplicates the mode ignores endorsed dataset.
“Use Power BI Dataflows”	Dataflows are used to create datasets not consume them.
“Edit a .pbix file with an existing connection”	You can’t connect one .pbix to multiple data sources.

## 🧠 Memory Hook

“Dataflows build datasets,
Datasets serve reports.”

## 🧩 Exam Tips - Data connection and connecting to endoresed data sets

If the question mentions:

“endorsed dataset” = “certified model”, or “standardized data” → ✅ Connect via Power BI Service Live Connection

“Azure SQL source” = “data warehouse”, or “ETL process” → ✅ Use Dataflow or DirectQuery

“Reusable report” or “shared business logic” → ✅ Use Endorsed Dataset

## Power Query Transformation Logic 

## 🧩 Question Context

You need to make sure that the labels for the country are consistent.
What should you do?
✅ Answer: Apply the Replace Values transform to the Country column.

## 🧠 Explanation

## 1️⃣ What the problem means

In Power BI, "labels for country" refers to text inconsistencies like:

“USA” vs “U.S.A.” vs “United States”

“UK” vs “United Kingdom”

“India ” (with extra space) vs “india”

These inconsistencies break relationships, groupings and aggregations (e.g., “United States” might be counted twice under different spellings).

## 2️⃣ Why Replace Values is correct

Replace Values is a data cleaning transformation that substitutes one text value with another without deleting rows.
This makes it ideal for standardizing inconsistent labels.

## ✅ Example:

Before	After
USA	United States
U.S.A.	United States
United States	United States

In Power Query:

🧩 Transform → Replace Values → Replace "U.S.A." with "United States"

So you retain all rows, just ensuring consistency.

## 3️⃣ Why NOT the other options
Option	Why Incorrect
Remove Duplicates	Deletes rows. If two entries are valid but labeled differently you lose data.
Convert to List	Removes other columns entirely used only for list transformations not text standardization.
Set Data Category to Country	Helps mapping visuals (e.g., map charts) but doesn’t clean inconsistent names.

## ⚙️ Best Practice

Always standardize text columns (like Country, Region, or Department) before relationships or joins.

Use Trim, Clean and Replace Values to ensure:

- No trailing spaces

- Consistent casing

- Standard naming conventions

## 🧠 Exam Tip

## If a question mentions:

“Make labels consistent” or “Standardize text entries”
✅ Choose Replace Values.
If it mentions:
“Remove duplicate records”
✅ Choose Remove Duplicates.

## 🧩 Memory Hook

“Replace fixes labels, Remove deletes rows.”

## 📘 Explanation – Editing Excel Workbooks from OneDrive in Power BI

This question tests how Power BI interacts with cloud-stored Excel files, specifically OneDrive for Business.

## ❌ The Misconception:

“The Excel workbook can be edited in Power BI.”

You cannot edit an Excel file directly inside Power BI Desktop or Power BI Service.
Power BI imports or connects to Excel files as a data source, but editing must be done externally — in Excel itself.

## ✅ Correct Behavior:

If the Excel file is stored in OneDrive for Business or SharePoint Online, Power BI maintains a live connection to it.
That means:

You edit the Excel file in Excel (or Excel Online).

Power BI automatically refreshes to reflect those changes, typically within an hour.

You do not need to re-import or re-upload the file.

## 🧠 Exam Tip - Editing workbook Onedrive from Power BI:

Task	Tool / Location	Notes
Edit data	Excel (desktop or online)	Not Power BI
Connect to Excel file	Power BI Desktop / Service	Use OneDrive or SharePoint path
Auto-refresh	Power BI Service	Keeps synced automatically
Replace with updated workbook	Do it in OneDrive	Power BI detects and refreshes

## ⚙️ Memory Hook:

“Power BI reads, Excel writes.”
You read data from Excel in Power BI, but all edits happen in Excel, not in Power BI.

## 🧠 Explanation — AVERAGEX with KEEPFILTERS in Power BI

This question tests your understanding of row context vs. filter context and the correct DAX function combination for dynamic aggregation measures.

✅ Correct Measure:
Average Product Profit =
AVERAGEX(
    KEEPFILTERS(VALUES('financials'[Product])),
    CALCULATE(AVERAGE('financials'[Profit]))
)

## 📘 Why This Is Correct
1. AVERAGEX

Iterates row by row across the table (or product list).

For each row (product), it calculates an expression (here, the average profit per product).

Then, it returns the average of all those results.
This makes it dynamic and compatible with visuals and filters in Power BI.

2. KEEPFILTERS()

Ensures that any existing filters in visuals (e.g., category, region) are preserved.

Without KEEPFILTERS, CALCULATE() could overwrite filter context, giving misleading results.

It effectively says: “Keep the existing filter context but evaluate my custom logic within it.”

3. CALCULATE(AVERAGE(...))

CALCULATE changes the context to evaluate the average profit per filtered product.

Wrapping the AVERAGE inside CALCULATE ensures the result updates based on slicers or applied filters.

## ⚠️ Why Other Options Are Wrong

Option	Problem
AVERAGE() alone	Aggregates all rows without respecting row context → wrong for per-product logic.
FILTER()	Returns a table, not a scalar — cannot be directly used for numeric measure output.
ALL()	Removes all filters → breaks product-level granularity and makes results misleading.
SUMMARIZE()	Used for table construction, not for numeric measure evaluation.
🧩 Exam Tip
Function	Role	Common Trap
AVERAGE()	Static column average	Ignores context when combined with filters
AVERAGEX()	Row-wise dynamic average	Correct for filtered calculations
KEEPFILTERS()	Keeps external filters active	Without it, CALCULATE may override filters
CALCULATE()	Changes filter context	Must output a scalar expression (like AVERAGE or SUM)

## Memory Hook:

“AVERAGEX calculates row by row — AVERAGE just looks at the whole column.”

🧠 Add to Notes (📘 DAX & Context → Iterators & Filters Section)

## New Entry:

AVERAGEX + KEEPFILTERS Pattern

Use when you need to compute a filtered dynamic average per category.

AVERAGEX() iterates across each unique product or dimension.

KEEPFILTERS() ensures visual or slicer context isn’t lost.

Always wrap the aggregation (like AVERAGE, SUM) inside CALCULATE() to make it context-aware.

## 🧠 Why Use Cross Filter Direction = Both in Power BI (RLS Scenario)

Let’s break down the logic from your question about Employee and Region tables and why Cross Filter Direction = Both is required for Row-Level Security (RLS) to function correctly.

## 🔗 Background — The Relationship Setup

Employee Table → contains many employees.

Region Table → contains unique regions (e.g., “East”, “West”).

They are linked through RegionID.

Cardinality: Many-to-One (Many Employees → One Region).

This is a standard star schema setup.

## 🔒 What RLS (Row-Level Security) Does

Row-Level Security filters data based on user roles or attributes — for example:

A Regional Manager should only see data for employees in their assigned region.

If RLS is applied to the Region table, Power BI must propagate that filter down to the Employee table.

However, this propagation depends on the filter direction of the relationship.

## 🔄 Why You Need Cross Filter = Both

Normally relationships filter from the “One” side → to the “Many” side.

That means filtering Region → Employee works automatically.

But RLS often needs both directions, especially when:

Filters are defined at the employee level (e.g., login context or security table).

The role-based filter must travel back up to the related tables (Region → Employee or Employee → Region).

By setting Cross Filter Direction = Both, you allow Power BI to:

Propagate security filters in both directions, ensuring both Employee and Region data align.

Maintain consistent visibility (e.g., hiding employees in unauthorized regions and removing those regions from visuals).

## ⚙️ Why “Apply Security Filter in Both Directions” Is Also Needed

The “Apply security filter in both directions” checkbox reinforces RLS logic beyond normal filters:

Ensures bi-directional filtering specifically for security roles.

Prevents bypassing RLS by navigating through related tables.

Is crucial when a dimension table (Region) filters a fact table (Employee), or vice versa.

## 💡 Memory Trick cross filter:

Cross Filter = Both → enables filter flow both ways.
Apply Security Filter Both Ways → extends that behavior to security roles.

## ⚠️ Why Not Change Cardinality

You should not set cardinality to One-to-One:

Many employees can belong to one region → this is a Many-to-One relationship.

Changing to One-to-One would break data integrity and cause incorrect filtering.

## 🧩 Exam Tip — Quick Recall Grid
Setting	Purpose	When to Use
Single Direction	Filters flow one way (default)	Safe for performance; standard relationships
Both Direction	Filters flow both ways	Needed for RLS, shared dimensions, or complex reporting
Apply Security Filter in Both Directions	Enforces RLS filter sync	Mandatory when securing related tables
One-to-One	Rare, use only for unique keys	Not for Employee–Region setups

## ✅ Summary

For RLS between Employee and Region:

Set Cross Filter Direction = Both

Enable Apply Security Filter in Both Directions

## 📘 What Are M Formulas in Power BI?

M formulas (or Power Query M language) are the scripting and formula language used inside the Power Query Editor in Power BI, Excel and other Microsoft data tools.

## 🧩 What “M” Stands For

The “M” in Power Query stands for Mashu  as the language is designed for data mashups  combining, transforming and cleaning data from multiple sources before loading it into Power BI.

Example:

= Table.AddColumn(Source, "Total Price", each [Quantity] * [Unit Price])


This formula adds a new column called Total Price that multiplies two columns from the source table.

## ⚙️ Where M Is Used

You encounter M formulas in:

The Power Query Editor (Transform Data window)

## The Advanced Editor

Custom column or parameter creation

Function or query editing (behind the GUI)

You can view or edit M code for any transformation by selecting:

## Home → Advanced Editor

## 🧠 Key Concepts of M Language
Concept	Description
Case-sensitive	Table.AddColumn ≠ table.addcolumn
Functional language	Everything is an expression that returns a value (no loops or variables in the traditional sense).
Step-based	Each transformation step depends on the one above it (chained by = and references like #“Changed Type”).
Immutable data	You can’t directly change a value — you create a new version with the transformation applied.

## 🧮 Example M Formula Breakdown
let
    Source = Excel.Workbook(File.Contents("C:\Sales.xlsx"), null, true),
    SalesData = Source{[Name="Sheet1"]}[Content],
    ChangedType = Table.TransformColumnTypes(SalesData, {{"Amount", type number}}),
    Filtered = Table.SelectRows(ChangedType, each [Amount] > 1000)
in
    Filtered


Step-by-step explanation:

Source – Loads data from Excel.

SalesData – Selects the “Sheet1” table.

ChangedType – Converts the “Amount” column to a number.

Filtered – Keeps only rows where “Amount” > 1000.

in Filtered – Returns the final output of the query.

## 🧰 Common M Functions
Function	Purpose
Table.SelectRows	Filters rows based on a condition
Table.AddColumn	Adds a calculated column
Table.RenameColumns	Renames one or more columns
Text.Upper	Converts text to uppercase
Number.Round	Rounds a numeric value
Date.AddDays	Adds or subtracts days from a date

## 💡 M vs DAX — Key Difference
Aspect	M (Power Query)	DAX (Data Model)
Stage	Before load (ETL stage)	After load (in the model)
Purpose	Transform & clean data	Create measures & calculations
Case sensitivity	Case-sensitive	Case-insensitive
Data refresh	Runs on refresh only	Runs during report interaction
Example	Table.AddColumn(...)	CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]))

## USERELATIONSHIPS Common use cases beyond DAX

## 🧠 What USERELATIONSHIP() Actually Does

When you have multiple relationships between two tables (for example, between a Date table and a Sales table), only one relationship can be active at a time.

However, sometimes you need to use a different relationship temporarily — that’s where USERELATIONSHIP() comes in.

It’s used inside DAX measures (not in Power Query) to tell Power BI:

“For this calculation, use this other relationship instead of the active one.”

## 📘 Syntax
CALCULATE(<expression>, USERELATIONSHIP(<column1>, <column2>))


## Example:

Sales by Ship Date =
CALCULATE(
    SUM(Sales[Amount]),
    USERELATIONSHIP(Sales[ShipDate], 'Date'[Date])
)


You might already have an active relationship between 'Date'[Date] and Sales[OrderDate].

The USERELATIONSHIP() function temporarily switches to use Sales[ShipDate] for this calculation.

## ⚙️ Use Cases Beyond RLS

Use Case	Description
Multiple Date Columns	When a fact table (e.g., Sales) has multiple date fields (OrderDate, ShipDate, DeliveryDate). Only one can be active — use USERELATIONSHIP() to reference others.
Scenario Analysis	For example, “What if we use planned vs actual delivery dates” — switch relationships dynamically.
Custom Time Intelligence	Compare metrics based on different time contexts (e.g., invoiced vs payment dates).
RLS (Row-Level Security)	In some cases, USERELATIONSHIP() is used within security filters to define alternate relationships for filtering, but this is not its primary or only purpose.
🚫 Common Misunderstanding

## Common thought pattern

“USERELATIONSHIP() is for Row-Level Security.”

That’s only partially true — while RLS filters can use it, the function itself is a DAX modeling tool, not a security feature.

RLS rules (like FILTER() or RELATEDTABLE()) can use it to control which relationship Power BI applies for filtering users’ data visibility — but that’s a specialized scenario.

## 💡 Exam Tip (PL-300) - USERRELATIONSHIP

If the question mentions:

“A table has two relationships with another table, but only one is active…”

✅ The correct answer is often to use USERELATIONSHIP() in a measure.

“RLS must filter through a non-active relationship…”

✅ Then, USERELATIONSHIP() may be used inside the security DAX rule — but the key concept is that it activates an inactive relationship temporarily.

✅ Explanation: Performance Analyzer Process in Power BI

This question tests your understanding of how to identify slow visuals in a Power BI report using the Performance Analyzer tool — which measures how long visuals take to render, query data, and process DAX calculations.

## ⚙️ Correct Order of Steps

1. Add a blank report page
→ Prevents cached visuals from affecting results.
→ Ensures the analyzer measures fresh visual rendering times.

2. Restart Power BI Desktop
→ Clears both visual cache and data engine cache for accurate timing.

3. Start recording in Performance Analyzer
→ Enables Power BI to log visual performance metrics.

4. Interact with the visuals
→ Triggers each visual to render and be measured.

5. Stop recording and review the results
→ Displays load time for visuals, including:

6. DAX Query Time (data engine)

Visual Display Time (rendering)

Other Time (miscellaneous background tasks)

## 🔍 Why Each Step Matters
Step	Purpose	Common Mistake
1️⃣ Add blank page	Avoid cached visuals	Running analyzer on an old page gives false times.
2️⃣ Restart Desktop	Clear caches	Skipping restart means cached data inflates results.
3️⃣ Start recording	Begin timing visuals	Forgetting to record yields no log data.
4️⃣ Interact with visuals	Trigger refresh	Not interacting means nothing is measured.
5️⃣ Stop & review	Get performance report	Exiting without review misses insights.

## 🧠 How to Interpret Results - Performance Analyzer

Performance Analyzer outputs time spent in three categories:

DAX Query → Time Power BI took to query the model.

Visual Display → Time to render visuals (graphics/UI).

Other → Time for background processes (e.g., filters, calculations).

## 💡 You can also copy the performance data to clipboard → paste into Excel for deeper analysis.

## 🧩 Exam Tip (PL-300)

## Exam Tips - Performance Analyzer

“Identify visuals with slow performance” → Use Performance Analyzer

“Clear cache or measure load time” → Restart Power BI + blank page

“Measure DAX query duration” → Performance Analyzer, not Query Diagnostics



## 🏁 Final Exam-Day Reminders

- Read each scenario twice; highlight keywords (data latency, governance, self-service).
- Validate calculation context—ask: **Which table? Which filters? Which grain?**
- Favor maintainable solutions (field parameters, reusable measures, shared datasets).
- Cross-check visualization requirements: compare vs filter vs highlight.
- Keep calm: you can revisit flagged items; ensure every question has an answer.
